#The solution I've built takes a blog-like appearance for submitting questions and leaving answers. The articles are listed
#on the index of the site, you can view them by hitting 'Read More', they can be updated and deleted, with two convenient buttons
#in their respective views. When an article is selected, its body and title are translated to German using Microsoft Translator. To leave an answer uses a ckeditor, which allows HTML responses.
#To use this application, you can navigate to the home page, create or view an article, leave an answer or view answers.
